  ðŸ“˜ Description:
  This project controls 3 LEDs, a buzzer, and an OLED display using two buttons.
  It demonstrates the use of **interrupts**, **software debouncing**, and 
  **OLED feedback** on an ESP32 board.

  âž¤ Button 1 (MODE):
      â€¢ Cycles through 4 LED modes (each shown on OLED)
          0 â†’ Both OFF
          1 â†’ Alternate Blink
          2 â†’ Both ON
          3 â†’ PWM Fade Effect

  âž¤ Button 2 (RESET):
      â€¢ Resets back to Mode 0 (All OFF)

  âž¤ OLED Display:
      â€¢ Shows the current mode or event message.

  âž¤ Buzzer:
      â€¢ Beeps briefly on each button press as feedback.
